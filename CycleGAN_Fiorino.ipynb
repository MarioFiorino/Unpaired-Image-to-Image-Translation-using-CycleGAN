        "\n",
        "Within the machine learning, the GAN is certainly the most interesting idea of the last 10 years, which has shown remarkable results and a wide versatility. Basically, Generative Adversarial Networks consist in two networks, called generator and discriminator: generator tries to riproduce samples from the true data distribution, while the discriminators try to classify a sample, if it comes from true data distribution or is produced by the generator. The ottimal effect of this is: the generator learns to approximate the true distribution completely, and the discriminator is not able to distinguish between the two distribution, so it is left guessing randomly.\n",

        "# Image-to-image translation and the problem of paired data\n",
        "\n",
        "Image-to-image translation is a class of computer vision , its goal is to learn how transform an image from one representation into another, preserving the semantic of input. Many problems in computer vision can be posed as a translation problem: style transfer,colorizing, semantic segmentation,photo enhancement....\n",
        "\n",
        "So far the most interesting and promising results obtained in this field come from the application of generative adversarial networks. One of the first works that has used this type of approach was Pix2Pix ( presented by Phillip Isola 2016 https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07004 ). The model works in this way : the generator receives in  input image A, and  translate it in the domain B, producing \"gen_B\" . The discriminator is fed with two input: (A, gen_B), and yields the probability that, given A, \"gen_B\" is the real mapping of A in the domain B . \n",
        "\n",
        "Pix2Pix has produced very good results, but each image from the  first domain must have a corresponding image in the second domain: the pair (A,B). So here the challenge is in training dataset : a paired training dataset is often more difficult and expensive to obtain than an unpaired one, and for many tasks, it is just not feasible! This is where the CycleGAN comes in."
